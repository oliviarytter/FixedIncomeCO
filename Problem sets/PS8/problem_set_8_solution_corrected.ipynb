    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convergence:** The price estimate stabilizes after ~2000-3000 simulations, showing convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard Error:** The Monte Carlo standard error is $\\sigma_{MC}/\\sqrt{N}$ where $\\sigma_{MC}$ is the sample standard deviation. With $N=10000$, we achieve good precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accuracy Consideration:** \n",
    "   - The estimate has converged (stable as $N$ increases)\n",
    "   - However, accuracy depends on $M$ (discretization fineness)\n",
    "   - With $M=1000$ time steps over 2 years ($\\delta = 0.002$), discretization error should be small\n",
    "   - To verify accuracy, we would need to increase $M$ and check if the result changes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Price:** The Asian-style derivative is worth approximately 0.0345 (3.45% of notional)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Distinction:** Convergence (Monte Carlo error) and accuracy (discretization error) are separate concepts. An estimator can converge quickly but still be inaccurate if the time discretization is too coarse."

    "### Key Concepts for Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ho-Lee Model:**\n",
    "- Constant volatility, time-varying drift\n",
    "- Affine term structure: $p(t,T) = e^{A(t,T) - B(t,T)r_t}$\n",
    "- Forward rate dynamics: $df(t,T) = \\sigma^2(T-t)dt + \\sigma dW_t$\n",
    "- Gaussian interest rates (can be negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nelson-Siegel Parametrization:**\n",
    "- Flexible term structure representation\n",
    "- Parameters control shape: level, slope, curvature\n",
    "- Links to incomplete gamma functions\n",
    "- Enables smooth calibration to market data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monte Carlo Simulation:**\n",
    "- Essential for complex derivatives\n",
    "- Convergence rate: $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$\n",
    "- Discretization error separate from Monte Carlo error\n",
    "- Must assess both convergence and accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implementation:**\n",
    "- Use `fid` module functions when available (theta_ho_lee, simul_ho_lee, etc.)\n",
    "- Implement custom functions only when needed (Nelson-Siegel forward/ZCB)\n",
    "- Use scipy.special.gammainc for incomplete gamma functions\n",
    "- Follow coding style from example scripts\n",
    "- Create clear, publication-quality plots\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exam Preparation Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Master the theory:** Understand derivations, not just formulas\n",
    "2. **Practice coding:** Be comfortable with numpy, scipy, matplotlib\n",
    "3. **Interpret results:** Always explain economic meaning\n",
    "4. **Time management:** 12 hours is long but finite - prioritize systematically\n",
    "5. **Code quality:** Write clean, well-structured code with clear variable names"
